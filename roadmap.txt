# SEC Filing Tools Roadmap

## 2025-03-07: Consolidated Logging System

### Changes Made:
1. Simplified logging implementation:
   - Consolidated multiple logger instances into a single unified logger
   - Implemented a singleton pattern with global logger instance in utils/logger.py
   - Added component-specific prefixes to log messages ([Downloader], [PDF], [Conversation], etc.)
   - Standardized logging format across all components

2. Improved log file organization:
   - Moved all logs to a single timestamped file in the Logs directory
   - Added section boundary markers for better log readability
   - Configured appropriate log levels (INFO for file, WARNING for console)

3. Updated all components to use the new logging system:
   - Modified CompanyLookup class to use the unified logger
   - Updated SecFilingDownloader class and all its methods
   - Updated the main function to use the consolidated logger

### Benefits:
- Simplified code maintenance with a single logging implementation
- Improved debugging experience with better organized logs
- Reduced code duplication and complexity
- Enhanced log readability with consistent formatting and context prefixes

### Future Logging Improvements:
- Consider adding structured logging (JSON format) for better machine processing
- Implement log rotation for long-running applications
- Add configurable log levels via command line or environment variables

## 2025-03-07: Enhanced SEC Filing Downloader with Conversational Interface

### Changes Made:
1. Added conversational parameter extraction inspired by sec_chatv1.py
   - Implemented natural language understanding to extract company, form type, and year
   - Added confirmation mechanism to verify extracted parameters
   - Built interactive conversation loop to fill in missing parameters

2. Added interactive mode to sec_filing_downloader.py
   - Added --interactive command-line flag
   - Created process_conversation() method to handle interactive sessions
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing command-line usage

3. Code Improvements:
   - Simplified LLM initialization code in CompanyLookup._get_llm()
   - Set temperature to 0.0 for deterministic responses
   - Removed unnecessary model branching logic

### Future Development:
1. Add support for more specific section extraction in conversational mode
2. Implement conversation memory to maintain context across multiple queries
3. Add support for industry and company-size based queries
4. Consider integrating full SEC Chatbot functionality into the downloader
5. Adapt the codebase for web application usage
