# SEC Filing Tools Roadmap

## 2025-03-08: Integrated Official SEC-API Python Package

### Changes Made:
1. Implemented SEC filing retrieval using the official `sec-api` Python package:
   - Created a test script (test_direct_sec_api.py) to validate the official package approach
   - Updated the script to use `RenderApi` class from the official package
   - Improved error handling and logging for API responses
   - Simplified code by directly passing SEC.gov URLs to the API

### Benefits:
- Leveraged official API client for better reliability and maintainability
- Reduced code complexity compared to custom implementation
- Better adherence to SEC-API.io best practices
- Improved debugging with detailed logging

### Future Improvements:
- Integrate this approach into the main downloader component
- Implement caching to reduce API calls for frequently accessed documents
- Add additional fallback methods for handling service unavailability

## 2025-03-08: Simplified SEC-API.io Access with Archive Endpoint

### Changes Made:
1. Simplified SEC filing retrieval using SEC-API.io's archive endpoint:
   - Created a test script (sec_api_test.py) to validate different SEC-API.io access methods
   - Identified archive.sec-api.io as the most effective and direct method for accessing SEC filings
   - Refactored try_direct_document_access function to use the simpler archive.sec-api.io approach
   - Improved error handling with better retry logic for 429 and 503 responses
   - Added more detailed logging to track API request success/failure

### Benefits:
- Dramatically simplified SEC filing retrieval code (reduced from 100+ lines to ~40 lines)
- Improved reliability with a more direct, documented approach
- Better adherence to SEC-API.io best practices
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Improved handling of service unavailability (503 errors)

### Future Improvements:
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed documents
- Add support for multiple SEC-API.io endpoints as fallbacks

## 2025-03-08: Fixed SEC-API.io Access and LangChain Deprecation Warnings

### Changes Made:
1. Replaced direct SEC.gov access with SEC-API.io:
   - Modified try_direct_document_access function to use SEC-API.io instead of direct SEC.gov access
   - Extracts accession number from filing URL to use with SEC-API.io
   - Properly passes SEC API key from environment variables
   - Added better error handling and logging for API responses

2. Updated LangChain dependencies to fix deprecation warnings:
   - Changed imports from langchain_community.embeddings to langchain_huggingface for HuggingFaceEmbeddings
   - Changed imports from langchain_community.chat_models to langchain_openai for ChatOpenAI
   - Changed imports from langchain_community.embeddings to langchain_openai for OpenAIEmbeddings
   - Added langchain-huggingface==0.1.2 to requirements.txt

### Benefits:
- Fixed 403 errors from SEC.gov's anti-scraping measures
- Eliminated deprecation warnings from LangChain components
- Improved reliability of document retrieval
- Better adherence to SEC API guidelines

### Future Improvements:
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed documents
- Add better error recovery strategies if SEC-API.io is unavailable

## 2025-03-08: Improved SEC Filing Section Extraction

### Changes Made:
1. Implemented targeted section extraction based on query topic:
   - Added determine_relevant_sections function to identify 2-3 most relevant sections instead of extracting all sections
   - Used a combination of keyword matching and semantic relevance to select sections
   - Improved logging for section extraction to better track extraction process
   - Maintained direct document access as first attempt method

2. Added clear error messaging:
   - Enhanced logging to indicate which sections were identified as relevant
   - Made sure the system properly communicates when it can't find relevant information

### Benefits:
- Reduced API usage by focusing on only the most relevant sections
- Improved response time by minimizing data retrieval
- Better handling of SEC's rate limiting and 403 access errors
- More targeted answers derived from the most relevant sections

### Future Improvements:
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed sections
- Explore additional fallback methods if both direct access and section extraction fail
- Implement more sophisticated relevance detection using embeddings if needed

## 2025-03-07: Consolidated Logging System

### Changes Made:
1. Simplified logging implementation:
   - Consolidated multiple logger instances into a single unified logger
   - Implemented a singleton pattern with global logger instance in utils/logger.py
   - Added component-specific prefixes to log messages ([Downloader], [PDF], [Conversation], etc.)
   - Standardized logging format across all components

2. Improved log file organization:
   - Moved all logs to a single timestamped file in the Logs directory
   - Added section boundary markers for better log readability
   - Configured appropriate log levels (INFO for file, WARNING for console)

3. Updated all components to use the new logging system:
   - Modified CompanyLookup class to use the unified logger
   - Updated SecFilingDownloader class and all its methods
   - Updated the main function to use the consolidated logger

### Benefits:
- Simplified code maintenance with a single logging implementation
- Improved debugging experience with better organized logs
- Reduced code duplication and complexity
- Enhanced log readability with consistent formatting and context prefixes

### Future Logging Improvements:
- Consider adding structured logging (JSON format) for better machine processing
- Implement log rotation for long-running applications
- Add configurable log levels via command line or environment variables

## 2025-03-07: Enhanced SEC Filing Downloader with Conversational Interface

### Changes Made:
1. Added conversational parameter extraction inspired by sec_chatv1.py
   - Implemented natural language understanding to extract company, form type, and year
   - Added confirmation mechanism to verify extracted parameters
   - Built interactive conversation loop to fill in missing parameters

2. Added interactive mode to sec_filing_downloader.py
   - Added --interactive command-line flag
   - Created process_conversation() method to handle interactive sessions
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing command-line usage

3. Code Improvements:
   - Simplified LLM initialization code in CompanyLookup._get_llm()
   - Set temperature to 0.0 for deterministic responses
   - Removed unnecessary model branching logic

### Future Development:
1. Add support for more specific section extraction in conversational mode
2. Implement conversation memory to maintain context across multiple queries
3. Add support for industry and company-size based queries
4. Consider integrating full SEC Chatbot functionality into the downloader
5. Adapt the codebase for web application usage
